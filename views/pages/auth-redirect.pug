    h3 This route will handle redirection after ADFS authentication.
    p 
      .
        We intend to pass in the user's intended route as a state value mapped to an href.  This 
        was the method employed by the 2019 MathSoc website, which is currently registered with ADFS, at 
        services.mathsoc.uwaterloo.ca.

    p
      .
        In our implementation, if a user is redirected to ADFS before accessing the exam bank, the state would reflect that.
        Then, this route would be able to interpret the state and send the user to #[code /resources/exam-bank].

    p We'll have a smoother time developing the redirection functionality once this staging site is registered with ADFS. 
    p Thanks for the help!
